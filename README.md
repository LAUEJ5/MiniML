Metacircular OCaml language Interpreter with no type inference, ensuring Turing-completeness. Three iterations are implemented: one based on the substitution model, another on a dynamically scoped environment model, and a third featuring extensions such as lexical scoping.

To execute the program, OCaml will already need to be [installed](https://ocaml.org/). First select which method of evaluation you would like it to perfom in the very bottom of the evaluation.ml file. Next run the following commands in your terminal:

1. \# make all
2. \# ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind miniml.byte
3. \# ./miniml.byte

Et voila! Happy evaluating!
